# Oracle JDK Overrides

As I am writing this file (<2019-03-27>), the `iohk-ops` nixpkgs
pin is referencing an outdated oracle JDK. We are unable to build this
derivation since oracle only seems to give a public download link for its latest release 8.201 currently.

These derivation have been extracted from the Nixpkg's master.
